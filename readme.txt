# Turkish Sign Language Recognition (CNN & YOLO)

This project implements two AI models to recognize Turkish Sign Language (TSL) gestures:  
- A simple **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** based classifier  
- An object detection model using **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)**

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to classify hand gestures in Turkish Sign Language images such as "yes" and "no".  
The CNN model performs basic image classification, while YOLOv8 detects and localizes the gestures within images.

A relatively small Turkish Sign Language dataset was used. Techniques like early stopping, model checkpointing, and accuracy tracking are implemented during training.
